# Nice Buttons

Create and Share Nice Buttons with Tailwind CSS.

## Contributing

- Create a new folder in `components/buttons` with the name of your button.
- Code the style in `index.tsx`.
- Add the metadata in `meta.ts`.
  - Metadata should include the button name, description, author name and author GitHub URL.
- Add your button in `constants/burrons.ts`.
- Create a pull request with screenshots of your button.

> If your button needs to use some client side event like listening to the click event, you should add `use client` in the top of `index.tsx` file.
